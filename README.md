# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Module 14 Challenge where an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The purpose of this project is to visualize the top 10 bacterial species found in human belly buttons using a bar chart and a bubble chart, and also display metadata based on user selection.

The application allows users to:

* Select a Test Subject ID to view their respective top 10 bacteria found.
* Display demographic information related to the selected Test Subject.
* View bacterial data as a bar chart and bubble chart.

## Dashboard Preview

## Features

* **Bar Chart** : Displays the top 10 bacteria found for each individual.
* **Bubble Chart** : Displays bacteria cultures per sample.
* **Metadata Panel** : Shows demographic information such as age, gender, and location for the selected individual.

## Files in the Repository

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the dashboard.
* `app.js`: JavaScript file that contains functions to fetch data, build the charts, and render metadata.
* `samples.json`: JSON file containing all data on bacteria cultures and demographic information (accessed via URL).
* `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## Deployment

The project is deployed via GitHub Pages. 

## Usage

1. Open the dashboard.
2. Use the dropdown menu to select a Test Subject ID.
3. View the demographic information, bar chart (Top 10 Bacteria Found), and bubble chart (Bacteria Cultures Per Sample).
